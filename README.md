## How to Play

### Character Creation and Progression
*   **Create Your Character:** Start by creating your first character. Choose a class (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric) and customize their appearance.
*   **Level Up:** Your character will automatically gain experience and levels by engaging in activities.
*   **Stats and Equipment:** As your character levels up, their stats will increase. Equip new items from your inventory or the shop to further boost your power. Pay attention to class affinities for bonus stats!
*   **Retirement:** Once your character reaches a certain level, they can retire. Retiring a character allows them to pass on a powerful heirloom and a legacy bonus to their heir, making future generations stronger.

### Adventures and Combat
*   **Dungeons:** Send your character into dungeons to fight monsters, gain experience, and find loot. Dungeons have a recommended level and a boss at the end.
*   **Raids:** For higher-level characters and guilds, raids offer greater challenges and rewards. You'll need to join or create a guild to participate in raids.
*   **Combat:** Combat is automated. Your character and their party will fight enemies based on their stats and abilities.

### Social Features
*   **Tavern:** Visit the tavern to recruit new adventurers to join your party. A larger party means more combat power! You can refresh the available adventurers for a small gold cost.
*   **Relationships:** Your character and their party members will develop relationships over time, which can influence various aspects of the game.
*   **Guilds:** Create or join a guild to team up with other players (NPCs in this single-player version) for shared goals and raid progression. Donate gold to your guild to level it up.
*   **Shop:** The shop offers a rotating selection of equipment. Items around your current level will be available, along with one rare, high-level item. You can refresh the shop's inventory for 200 gold.

### Generations
*   **Heirs and Legacy:** When a character retires, you can choose an heir from their potential offspring. The heir will inherit a powerful heirloom and a permanent legacy bonus based on the retired character's achievements.
*   **Building a Dynasty:** Each new generation starts with advantages from their predecessors, allowing you to tackle increasingly difficult content and build a powerful family lineage.
